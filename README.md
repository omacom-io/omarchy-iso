# Omarchy ISO

The Omarchy ISO is the only supported way to install Omarchy. It ships the Omarchy Configurator, installs Arch Linux, installs the Omarchy packages from the bundled mirror, runs target system setup in the chroot, creates the user, and runs `omarchy-setup-user` for that user.

## Downloading the latest ISO

See the ISO link on [omarchy.org](https://omarchy.org).

## Creating the ISO

Run `./bin/omarchy-iso-make`; output goes into `./release`. By default the ISO uses the Omarchy packages and tracks the `quattro` branch, from the stable mirror. Pass `--edge` to use `omarchy-dev` and `omarchy-settings-dev` from the edge mirror.

For local development, build the ISO from sibling checkouts:

```bash
./bin/omarchy-iso-make --local-source ../omarchy-installer ../omarchy-pkgs
```

Despite the local folder name, the first argument is the Omarchy source checkout (runtime commands, configs, setup scripts, themes, shell, migrations). The installer itself lives in this ISO repo.

Use `--dev` or `--rc` to build against those package channels. Both `--dev` and `--edge` select the dev packages from the edge mirror.

## Testing the ISO

Run `./bin/omarchy-iso-boot [release/omarchy.iso]`.

## Signing the ISO

Run `./bin/omarchy-iso-sign [gpg-user] [release/omarchy.iso]`.

## Uploading the ISO

Run `./bin/omarchy-iso-upload [release/omarchy.iso]`. This requires rclone configuration (`rclone config`).

## Full release of the ISO

Run `./bin/omarchy-iso-release VERSION` to create, test, sign, and upload the ISO in one flow. Add `--rc` to release an RC build instead.
